                        <p>The name Abigail, which is my full name, means "Joy of the Father" or "Father's joy". Joy is
                            also my middle name, so I guess you could say I am double-the-joy! When I was a baby adults
                            would pass me around the room from person to person because I was so joyful I would
                            brighten
                            their day. I have helped people since birth. </p>

                        <h3>Education, Athletics and the Arts</h3>
                        <p>In grade school I was invovled in many things. I played sports, excelled academically and
                            enjoyed being creative in my free time. My favorite subjects in school were math and
                            history, however, in high school my favorite class was AP Calculus. I loved the challenge
                            and figuring out how to solve a problem. I did not start taking art until my senior year of
                            high school, but always loved to paint, draw or design.</p>
