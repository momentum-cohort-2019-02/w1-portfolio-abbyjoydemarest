                                    <p>In grade school I was invovled in many things. I played sports, excelled academically and
                                        enjoyed being creative in my free time. My favorite subjects in school were math and
                                        history, however, in high school my favorite class was AP Calculus. I loved the challenge
                                        and figuring out how to solve a problem. I did not start taking art until my senior year of
                                        high school, but always loved to paint, draw or design.</p>
