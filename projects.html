                        <p> This project was my first project! Though HTML is not used for styling purposes, I enjoyed
                            learning on my own about the ways you can use HTML to style your page. I mainly did this by
                            center-aligning my navigation bar, </p>

                        <h3>Education, Athletics and the Arts</h3>
                        <p>In grade school I was invovled in many things. I played sports, excelled academically and
                            enjoyed being creative in my free time. My favorite subjects in school were math and
                            history, however, in high school my favorite class was AP Calculus. I loved the challenge
                            and figuring out how to solve a problem. I did not start taking art until my senior year of
                            high school, but always loved to paint, draw or design.</p>
